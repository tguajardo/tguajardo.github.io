# My Profile Website

Welcome to my profile website! This site is a simple implementation of what I've learned in a CodeAcademy course. It is originally based on the [Bootstrap 5 user social profile with transition effect](https://bbbootstrap.com/snippets/bootstrap-5-user-social-profile-transition-effect-79746232#).

## Objective

- **Skills**: A comprehensive list of my technical and soft skills.
